<h1>The Best Movies According to Kien</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots (2009)</h3>
<p>
  This is one of my favorite movies. The movie is a motivation for someone who
  do not know what to do for the future. Someone do not know which jobs they
  should do in the future. After all, they just do whatever they like to do and
  follow it to the end of the road, they will know what to do and what they
  like.

<h3>The World War Z (2013)</h3>
<p>
  This is one of the movies that I watch over 10 times, but I never feel bored.
  This film is about Zombie. As you know, Zombie is not scary, the scariest
  thing is the human heart.

<h3>Miracle in cell number 7 (2013)</h3>
<p>
  I watched this film for 7 times. I cried so much when I watched the film.
  After I watched the film, I love my family so much. I recognize that "Family"
  is something sacred!
